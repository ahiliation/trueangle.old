It is in living and acting that man establishes his relationship with being,
with the truth and with the good. The artist has a special relationship to
beauty. In a very true sense it can be said that beauty is the vocation
bestowed on him by the Creator in the gift of artistic talent. And,
certainly, this too is a talent which ought to be made to bear fruit, in
keeping with the sense of the Gospel parable of the talents (cf. Mt
25:14-30).

Here we touch on an essential point. Those who perceive in themselves
this kind of divine spark which is the artistic vocationas poet, writer,
sculptor, architect, musician, actor and so onfeel at the same time
the obligation not to waste this talent but to develop it, in order to put
it at the service of their neighbour and of humanity as a whole.


John Paul II
Letter to Artists, (April 4, 1999)
The artistic vocation in the service of beauty
